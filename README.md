1. Timely delivery is crucial in software project management because delays can lead to cost overruns, missed market opportunities, and dissatisfied stakeholders. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by setting realistic timelines, using project management tools, prioritizing tasks, managing risks proactively, and maintaining clear communication with the team.

2. Effective cost control ensures that a software project stays within budget, preventing financial losses. Strategies include detailed budget planning, continuous monitoring of expenses, using cost estimation techniques (such as analogous or parametric estimation), and implementing change control processes to avoid scope creep.

3. Agile vs. Waterfall:
   - Agile: Iterative, flexible, customer-focused; allows continuous feedback and adaptation. However, it may lack predictability and require high stakeholder involvement.
   - Waterfall: Linear, structured, and well-documented; good for projects with clear requirements but lacks flexibility if changes are needed later.

4. When to use Agile vs. Waterfall:
   - Agile: Best for projects with evolving requirements, such as web applications, SaaS products, or mobile apps.
   - Waterfall: Ideal for projects with well-defined scopes, such as government contracts, banking systems, or infrastructure software.

5. Quality assurance methods: Code reviews, automated testing, continuous integration, user acceptance testing, and maintaining coding standards. High standards ensure reliability, security, and a positive user experience.

6. Project scope defines boundaries and deliverables, preventing scope creep. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of tasks, making project planning more manageable and improving resource allocation.

7. Benefits of a project schedule: Provides a roadmap for the team, improves time management, and helps track progress. Gantt charts visually represent task timelines, dependencies, and deadlines, aiding in project coordination.

8. Core issues addressed by software: Typically include inefficiencies, automation needs, or customer pain points. These problems are significant as they impact productivity, costs, or user experience.

9. Clearly defining the problem ensures the software solution addresses the actual need rather than symptoms, leading to a more focused and effective design.

10. Describing the software solution: Present it in terms of user benefits (e.g., "A platform that streamlines inventory management, reducing manual effort and errors").

11. Key features that make software stand out: Unique functionalities, ease of use, security, integration capabilities, and performance efficiency.

12. Market size and growth potential: Data can be gathered from industry reports, market research firms, and competitor analysis.

13. Understanding market trends helps position software effectively, identify emerging needs, and stay ahead of competitors by adapting to industry changes.
